# Mixing Statistics Lab

**Solid mixing** involves the blending of different solid particles to achieve homogeneity in composition. In particle technology and process engineering, it plays a crucial role in ensuring uniformity in materials, which is essential for product quality, efficiency, and consistency in various processes such as pharmaceutical manufacturing, food production, and chemical synthesis. Effective solid mixing enhances product performance, reduces production costs, and minimizes waste.

One of the most important questions in this regard is what a *good mixture* actually is, i.e. how to **quantify homogeneity**. This requires a thorough statistical treatment which can be confusing at times (especially for us engineers :cold_sweat:).

This lab provides a simplified mixing simulation that allows us to play around with various parameters like sample size, number of samples, mixing time, etc. Additionally, the aspects of deadzones and de-mixing are covered.

>**Note:** The lab notes are in german, while the Python script is commented in English.
